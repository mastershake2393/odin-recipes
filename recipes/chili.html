            <li>2.5 pounds 85% lean ground beef</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion (or 2 small), minced</li>

            <li>1 red bell pepper, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ancho chile powder</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
    </head>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by combining the ground beef, salt, baking soda, and water in a large bowl. Using your hands, mix until evenly combined. Let the beef mixture sit for 20 minutes. The baking soda raises the pH of the meat, helping to lock in moisture and accelerate browning.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, chop the veggies. I use a food processor to speed this up, but it is fine to chop by hand too.</li>
            <li>In a large pot over medium heat, heat the oil and add the onions, garlic, and red pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the beef and increase the heat to high. Cook, stirring with wooden spoon to break up the meat, until the beef is browned, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>The beef will release a lot of fat and liquid — do not drain it; you will skim the fat off at the end. Add the ancho chili powder, chipotle chili powder, cumin, oregano, coriander, smoked paprika, and cinnamon (if using).</li>
            <li>Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 to 2 minutes, until well combined and fragrant. Add the cornmeal, beef broth, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and molasses (if using).</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, for 2 hours. Skim any excess fat off of the surface of the chili — there will be quite a bit.</li>
            <li>Stir in the lime juice, then taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary. Serve with accompaniments and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
