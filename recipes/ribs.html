        <head><h3>Steps</h3></head>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Prepare ribs: Stir salt, white sugar, brown sugar, black pepper, white pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder, paprika, and cumin together in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Rub spice mixture all over ribs; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Make sauce: Stir apple juice, brown sugar, and barbeque sauce together until well combined. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Unwrap ribs and arrange in a single layer onto the wire racks of the smoker. Place the racks into a smoker, fill the smoker pan with apple, grape, pear, or cherry chips, and heat the smoker to 270 degrees F (130 degrees C). Cook ribs for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Brush ribs with sauce. Continue cooking ribs, basting with sauce every 30 to 40 minutes, until meat is no longer pink and begins to shrink back from bones, 3 to 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Brush sauce onto ribs one last time and remove them from the smoker. Wrap ribs tightly with aluminum foil and allow to rest until juices reabsorb into meat, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
